<h1>FOLLOW ME</h1>
<p> From childhood till now you might have been asked to follow many things by someone or the other. Now here we ask you, if your robot can follow your instructions or not?</p>
    <img src="images/followme.jpg"
<p>A line follower is an autonomous machine which is capable of sensing a given line and tracing it. The challenge is to make robot which can sense and follow a black line on the arena. There should not be any wired or wireless control by any operator which means that the robot is completely autonomous.</p>
<h2><br />
  TEAM SPECIFICATIONS</h2>
<p>  A team may consist of a maximum of 3-4 participants, they can hail from any institute (engineering institute).<br />
Entry fee: 250 INR for a 3 member team &amp; 300 INR for a 4 member team.</p>
<h2><br />
  DIMENSIONS AND FABRICATIONS</h2>
<p> The robot should fit inside a cube of side 200mm<br />
Note: There is no constraint on the weight of the robot.</p>
<h2><br />
  ROBOT CONTROL REQUIRMENTS</h2>
<p> Robot should be completely autonomous.</p>
<h2>  BATTERY AND POWER</h2>
<p> Off board power supplies are not allowed. All the power-supply must be onboard. The electric voltage between 2 points anywhere in the 'bot should not be more than 12 V DC at any point of time. If a team is using AC voltage in any of its parts then the voltage should not exceed 12V AC at any point of time as well.</p>
<h2><br />
  DISQUALIFICATION</h2>
<p>  a) Violation of 'bot specs.<br />
  b) Tampering the opponent's 'bot<br />
  c) Use of Readymade/Lego kits.<br />
Note: In no case should the arena be damaged by any bot.</p>
<h2><br />
  GENERAL RULES</h2>
<p>  . For every round a maximum of two trials will be given and thebest time of two recorded times will be considered.<br />
  . The robot is expected to follow the line accurately. If the robot deviates from the line, a maximum of two chances will be allowed accompanied by penalty.<br />
  . 5 minutes will be provided for the calibration of sensors.<br />
  . 10 minutes (optional) will be provided between the two trials.<br />
  . Points will be awarded on the basis of speed and accuracy<br />
. Penalties magnitude will be announced on the day of event.</p>
<h2><br />
  QUALIFYING ROUND</h2>
<p>  . This round basically tests the line following ability of the robot.<br />
  . It is mandatory to clear the qualifying round to progress into further rounds.<br />
. Magnitude of the penalty time if a team member wants to put the Line follower robot back on the line will be decided on the day of the event.</p>
<h2><br />
  ROUND 2 AND FINAL ROUND</h2>
<p>  . The arena for this round will be revealed on the day of the event.<br />
. Magnitude of the penalty time if a team member wants to put the Line follower robot back on the line will be decided on the day of the event.</p>
<h2><br />
  CERTIFICATE POLICY</h2>
<p>  1. Certificate of Merit will be given to all the winners.<br />
  2. Certificates of Participation will be given to all the teams.<br />
3. The teams which get disqualified due to disobeying any of the competition rules will not be considered for the certificate.</p>
<h2><br />
  DISCLAIMER</h2>
<p>  Judges' decision shall be treated as final and binding on all. Teams disobeying their word by arguing or creating a scene shall be disqualified.</p>
