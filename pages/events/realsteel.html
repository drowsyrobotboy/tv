<h2>MISSION</h2>
<p>This is a competition between 2 remote control robots. The main objective is to push the other opponent out of the ring within the given time period. The successful robot then moves onto the next round facing other winners from the round. The losers will be eliminated and in the end, the one robot that last is the main champion.<br />
</p>
<h2>TEAM SPECIFICATIONS</h2>
<p>  A team may consist of a maximum of 3-4 participants, they can hail from any institute (engineering institute).<br />
  Entry fee: 250 INR for a 3 member team &amp; 300 INR for a 4 member team.<br />
  </p>
<h2>DIMENSIONS AND FABRICATIONS</h2>
<p>  1. The 'bot should fit in a box of dimension 300mm*300mm(lxb) at every given point of the event. The external device used to control the 'bot is not included in the size constraint.<br />
  2. The 'bot should not exceed 7 kg of weight including the weight of batteries, wheels, detachable-attachments, etc. If the tank is external, its weight would be considered 1.5 times its actual weight. Weight of wireless robots will be counted as 0.75 x the actual weight.</p>
<h2>  ROBOT CONTROL REQUIRMENTS</h2>
<p>  1. The 'bot must be manually controlled (i.e. itcan be controlled wirelessly or with wires). Off board power supplies are not allowed.No external power will be given.<br />
  2. If the 'bot is wired then the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition. All the wires coming out of the 'bot should be stacked as a single unit. The wires should be properly insulated. Teams are suggested to use only rated wires. Loose connections or improper wiring may lead to direct disqualification even before the event.<br />
  3. If the 'bot is controlled wirelessly, the 'bot must at least have a four frequency remote control circuit or two dual control circuits which may be interchanged before the start of the race to avoid frequency interference with other teams. The case of any interference in the wireless systems will not be considered for rematch or results.<br />
  4. Remote control systems from toys might be used. Remote control systems available in the market may also be used.</p>
<h2>  BATTERY AND POWER</h2>
<p>  1. The 'bot can be powered electrically only. Use of an IC engine in any form is not allowed.<br />
  2. The electric voltage between 2 points anywhere in the 'bot should not be more than 12 V DC at any point of time. If a team is using AC voltage in any of its parts then the voltage should not exceed 12V AC at any point of time as well.</p>
<h2>  DISQUALIFICATION</h2>
<p>  a. Violation of 'bot specs.<br />
  b. Robots can't have any kind of magnetic weapons , flame-based weapons, cutters, saws,any kind of explosive or intentionally ignited solid or potentially ignitable solid radio jamming, tazers, tesla coils, or any other high-voltage device, high power magnets or electromagnets, spinning weapons , tethered or un-tethered projectiles, spinning hammers etc. as weapons with following exceptions and limitations:<br />
  - Flippers<br />
  - Lifting devices<br />
  c. Tampering the opponent's 'bot<br />
