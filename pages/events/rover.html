<h1><strong>Rover:</strong>
</h1>
<p><strong><u>Â </u></strong>Here are some of the most  inhospitable terrains on earth which are eagerly waiting to give you a taste of  pure agony. Is your heart still beating!! Can your machine survive? Tune-up  your eXtreme Machines for this adventurous journey.</p>
<h2>Mission: </h2>
<p align="left">Teams have to make a 'bot  that can traverse through various terrains that come across its way  (all-terrain track). Remember time is money, so make it sleek, stealthy and  fast.</p>
<h2 align="left">TEAM SPECIFICATIONS </h2>
<p align="left">A team may consist of a  maximum of 3-4 participants.A team may comprise of any engineering student  hailing from any college/institute or technological university (members from  different colleges can form a team).<br />
<strong>Entry fee:</strong>&nbsp;250 INR for a 3 member team  &amp; 300 INR for a 4 member team.</p>
<h2 align="left">DIMENSIONS AND FABRICATIONS </h2>
<p align="left">The 'bot should fit in a box  of dimension 250mm*250mm(lxb) (no height restriction) at every given point of  the event. The external device used to control the 'bot is not included in the  size constraint.</p>
<h2 align="left">ROBOT CONTROL REQUIRMENTS </h2>
<p align="left">1. The 'bot must be manually  controlled (i.e. it can be controlled wirelessly or with wires. Off board power  supplies are not allowed. All the power-supply must be onboard. Refer below for  further details on battery and power.<br />
  2. If the 'bot is wired then  the wire should remain slack under all circumstances during the competition.  All the wires coming out of the 'bot should be stacked as a single unit. The  wires should be properly insulated. Teams are suggested to use only rated  wires. Loose connections or improper wiring may lead to direct disqualification  even before the event.<br />
  3. If the 'bot is controlled  wirelessly, the 'bot must at least have a four frequency remote control circuit  or two dual control circuits which may be interchanged before the start of the  race to avoid frequency interference with other teams. The case of any  interference in the wireless systems will not be considered for rematch or  results.<br />
4. Remote control systems  from toys might be used. Remote control systems available in the market may  also be used.</p>
<h2 align="left">BATTERY AND POWER </h2>
<p align="left">1. The 'bot can be powered  electrically only. Use of an IC engine in any form is not allowed.<br />
2. The electric voltage  between 2 points anywhere in the 'bot should not be more than 12 V DC at any  point of time. If a team is using AC voltage in any of its parts then the  voltage should not exceed 12V AC at any point of time as well.</p>
<h2 align="left">DISQUALIFICATION </h2>
<p align="left">a) Violation of 'bot specs.<br />
  b) Tampering the opponent's  'bot<br />
  c) Using the wires to pull or  move the 'bot, i.e. in all cases the wire should remain slack, failure of which  might lead to disqualification.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;In no case should the arena be damaged by any bot.</p>
<h2 align="left">EVENT ROUNDS</h2>
<p align="left">1. The 'bot has to race  through the all-terrain track. The one who finishes in least time shall be the  winner.<br />
  2. Two chances will be given  and average of best two times will be considered<br />
  3. There shall be few  checkpoints. If a bot doesn't move/gets stuck then the team has an option of  restarting from the previous checkpoint or they can skip the zone if they find  it difficult to travel. But, they will be penalized for this and are restricted  to use this option only twice during the entire race.<br />
4. Arena will contain sand,  gravel, slopes, pits, slippery surfaces, shallow water, rollers, etc.</p>
<h2>PENALITIES</h2>
<p align="left">1. If the 'bot touches the  walls/boundaries of the track the team shall be penalized (+3 sec)<br />
  2. Skipping or  touching/restarting from checkpoint=&gt;10 second penalty.<br />
  <strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;In case of a tie, the  'bot with the minimum dimensions shall be declared the winner.</p>
<h2 align="left">ARENA SPECIFICATION</h2>
<p align="left">Arena will be revealed on the  date of event.</p>
<h2 align="left">CERTIFICATE  POLICY</h2>
<p align="left">1. Certificate of Merit will  be given to all the winners.<br />
  2. Certificates of  Participation will be given to all the teams.<br />
3. The teams which get  disqualified due to disobeying any of the competition rules will not be  considered for the certificate.</p>
<h2 align="left">DISCLAIMER</h2>
Judges'  decision shall be treated as final and binding on all. Teams disobeying their  word by arguing or creating a scene shall be disqualified..(The arena may vary  slightly, but shall remain more or less the same, so all participant teams are  advised to gear up for an all-terrain robo-race).
